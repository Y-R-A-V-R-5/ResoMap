# ResoMap – Experiment Sweep Configuration
# ============================================================
# Defines the experiment grid: models and resolutions to test
# 
# COMPLETED TRAINING (2 days, Feb 1-3, 2026):
#   - simple_cnn × 5 resolutions = 5 experiments ✓
#   - tiny_cnn × 5 resolutions = 5 experiments ✓
#   Total: 10 experiments completed
