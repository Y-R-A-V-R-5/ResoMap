# ResoMap – Main Configuration File
# ============================================================
# This is the main configuration file that references modular configs.
# Individual configuration files are organized by domain:
#   - sweep.yaml: Experiment grid (models, resolutions)
#   - training.yaml: Training hyperparameters
#   - system.yaml: GPU/system settings
#   - data.yaml: Dataset and augmentation
#   - explainability.yaml: Interpretation methods
#   - mlflow.yaml: Experiment tracking
#   - models.yaml: Model architectures
# ============================================================

project_name: "ResoMap"

description: >
  Resolution Sensitivity Analysis with GPU Acceleration.
  Measures accuracy, latency, GPU memory, and model explanations
  as a function of input resolution. Includes explainability
  analysis (Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients) to understand
  how different resolutions affect model decision-making.

# Configuration files are loaded automatically by utils.load_config()
# Individual configs available at:
#   config['sweep'], config['training'], config['system'], 
#   config['data'], config['explainability'], config['mlflow']
